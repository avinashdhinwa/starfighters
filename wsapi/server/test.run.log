We have\ntalked to some market makers for AOY Holdings and they spontaneously offered \"Yeah, it feels funny recently.\nCan't quite put my finger on it.\"\n\nWe used our regulatory authority to lean on the comptroller's brokerage, but his accounts are clean: he has no\nposition in AOY and hasn't in a decade.

We don't have enough resources to put the comptroller under surveillance and we don't have any evidence\nto justify a search warrant of his phone or email.\n\nWe need you to help us identify that accomplice.

We'll use a regulatory subpoena on their brokerage, get their information,\nand your evidence will be used to support a subpoena of their stored communications.
