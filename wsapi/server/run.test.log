Apparently their comptroller\nwas very underwater on his mortgage but recently, quote, \"a rich uncle died and left me a fortune.\"  We pulled birth\nrecords, marriage licenses, and social network profiles, and we believe no such uncle existed.\n\nWhen comptrollers suddenly come into a lot of money, it either means embezzlement or insider trading.  We have\ntalked to some market makers for UUKG Corporation and they spontaneously offered \"Yeah, it feels funny recently.\nCan't quite put my finger on it.\"\n\nWe used our regulatory authority to lean on the comptroller's brokerage, but his accounts are clean: he has no\nposition in UUKG and hasn't in a decade.  We suspect he has an accomplice on the outside.  We have no clue\nwho it is.  We don't have enough resources to put the comptroller under surveillance and we don't have any evidence\nto justify a search warrant of his phone or email.\n\nWe need you to help us identify that accomplice.  Find the account making the insider trades and give us hard evidence\nwhich supports them as being anomalous.  We'll use a regulatory subpoena on their brokerage, get their information,\nand your evidence will be used to support a subpoena of their stored communications.  If they've ever talked to the\ncomptroller, both of them are going to have a *very, very bad time.*\n\nWe regulate Wall Street but we don't work on it, so resources are limited.
